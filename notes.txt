BUGStofix:
imgui can behave weirdly in windowed mode. there's some additional yoffset for mouse input or something. (this is likely about xfce's window manager and SDL2 and some old versions of the two)
FIXED TEMPORARILY program seems to freeze if sound effect is playing, while trying to quit the program (cmixer's mutex stuff suspect)

TODO: (in rough order of importance)
armies should be able to attack each other
animate unit movement
zooming in should center camera to mouse cursor. maybe not all the way at once, but each zoom step should move it closer
edges can have several different travel costs (normal, flying, sailing, voice, woodsman)
pack path arrows into single draw call
build files for windows (VC++2015 /w build.bat)
fog or war
loader for shader code should handle wrong filenames better (now it seems to just segfault)

Other notes
-----------

armies block each other
enemies block movement, friends can pass each other, but not stop at same hex
one unit per hex
one move, one attack per turn. either one can be first. can't postpone second action, it must be taken immediately after.

zone of controls?
camera could use a rewrite

xeen's palette is quite pretty actually, could use that more if I bother with the graphics (background bmp has the palette atm)

terrain tiles:
https://cuddlyclover.itch.io/fantasy-hex-tiles
tile width: 32
tile height: 28 (height 48, stride 28)
side length: 16
y-offset: 2

Hex edges: (amit)
Iterate over all hexes H.
For each hex, iterate over all 6 neighbors D.
If D is on your game map, and H’s region and D’s region are different, draw the edge between H and D.
