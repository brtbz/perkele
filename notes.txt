BUGStofix:
imgui can behave weirdly in windowed mode. there's some additional yoffset for mouse input or something. (this is likely about xfce's window manager and SDL2 and some old versions of the two)
FIXED TEMPORARILY program seems to freeze if sound effect is playing, while trying to quit the program (cmixer's mutex stuff suspect)
custom text rendering disabled while I figure out why Windows doesn't like it
managed to move two units to one hex somehow, but couldn't reproduce that

TODO: (in rough order of importance)
clean up animation code a bit (timers end node start indices army moving moving army arming move)
end turn button!
units can move and attack once per turn
some kind of overlay that shows units' remaining hitpoints
two or more factions for armies
animation for attack (just a small bump against the attacked unit)
death animation and sound! (just disappear)
some kind of basic scenario with dozen or so units
more complex combat mechanics
zones of control for units
fog or war
devious and terrifying enemy AI to command armies of goblins all over the map and elsewhere
edges can have several different travel costs (normal, flying, sailing, voice, woodsman)
camera could use a rewrite, so it can (among other things) handle changing aspect ratio, so I can allow resizable window
zooming in should center camera to mouse cursor. maybe not all the way at once, but each zoom step should move it closer
pack path arrows into single draw call
loader for shader code should handle wrong filenames better (now it seems to just segfault)



building:
Linux (GCC)
--build bundled libraries and perkele: 'make all'
--build only perkele: 'make'
Windows (MSVC2015):
--build bundled libraries and perkele: 'build.bat'
--build only perkele: 'qbuild.bat'

dependencies: usual build stuff and SDL2

Other notes
-----------

hardware requirements!
minimum display size is 1024x600!
opengl 3.3

armies block each other
enemies block movement, friends can pass each other, but not stop at same hex
one unit per hex
one move, one attack per turn. either one can be first. can't postpone second action, it must be taken immediately after.



xeen's palette is quite pretty actually, could use that more if I bother with the graphics (background bmp has the palette atm)

terrain tiles:
https://cuddlyclover.itch.io/fantasy-hex-tiles
tile width: 32
tile height: 28 (height 48, stride 28)
side length: 16
y-offset: 2

Hex edges: (amit)
Iterate over all hexes H.
For each hex, iterate over all 6 neighbors D.
If D is on your game map, and H’s region and D’s region are different, draw the edge between H and D.
