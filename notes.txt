BUGStofix:
imgui can behave weirdly in windowed mode. there's some additional yoffset for mouse input or something.
FIXED TEMPORARILY program seems to freeze if sound effect is playing, while trying to quit the program (cmixer's mutex stuff suspect)

TODO: (in rough order of importance)
pathfinder can't handle islands yet
way to show all the hexes that are reachable with currently available movement points
armies should be able to attack each other
dynamic cursor (separate attack and movement symbols)
zooming in should center camera to mouse cursor. maybe not all the way at once, but each zoom step should move it closer
edges can have several different travel costs (normal, flying, sailing, voice, woodsman)
pack path arrows into single draw call
build files for windows (VC++2015 /w build.bat)
fog or war
loader for shader code should handle wrong filenames better (now it seems to just segfault)

Other notes
-----------

Colorful hardware mouse cursors seem to be doable with SDL, yay
armies block each other
enemies block movement, friends can pass each other, but not stop at same hex
one unit per hex
zone of controls?
camera could use a rewrite

magnify filter pitää olla nearest neighbor, muuten näyttää kamalalta
xeen's palette is quite pretty actually, could use that more if I bother with the graphics (background bmp has the palette atm)

terrain tiles:
https://cuddlyclover.itch.io/fantasy-hex-tiles
tile width: 32
tile height: 28 (height 48, stride 28)
side length: 16
y-offset: 2

Hex edges: (amit)
Iterate over all hexes H.
For each hex, iterate over all 6 neighbors D.
If D is on your game map, and H’s region and D’s region are different, draw the edge between H and D.
